## 2.1. Choosing a Micro-Controller

When it came to choosing a microcontroller for the project three options were considered

1.      MSP40FR6989 microcontroller (MCU)

2.      The Arduino

3.      The Raspberry Pi

### Comparison of the three options

Choosing the Raspberry Pi is preferred because

1.      It supports python which is the preferred language of the interns

2.      It has a more equipped hardware to tackle the image processing required for the project

3.      Connecting two identical cameras to capture images simultaneously can be easily done with the raspberry pi through USB webcams or IP cameras. Using any other camera setup would require camera multiplexing which doesn’t support simultaneous image capture.

## 2.2.    Choosing a Camera

Two identical cameras were to be chosen for the stereo camera setup and are to capture images at the same time. Based on these criteria our top pick would be to use USB webcams with the raspberry pi.

The Logitech Webcams is a possible option.
